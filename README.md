This is a JQuery plugin that allows you to create an high quality justified gallery of images. 

A common problem, for people who create sites, is to create an elegant image gallery that manages the various sizes of images. Flickr and Google+ manage this situation in an excellent way, the purpose of this plugin is to give you the power of this solutions, with a new fast algorithm.

Important configurations
------------------------

An important configuration of the plugin is the row height. If you have an height of 100px, the algorithm resizes the images to have an height of 100px, for example: 

<img src="http://miromannino.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/fig1.png" style="width: 100%; max-width:450px;" />

Then, if the row is full, the algorithm removes the images that canâ€™t stay in the same row, and resizes their width to fill the entire row. 

<img src="http://miromannino.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/fig2.png" style="width: 100%; max-width:374px;" />

This increases the row height (or cuts the images if you have configured the plugin to have a <i>fixed height</i>).

<img src="http://miromannino.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/fig3.png" style="width: 100%; max-width:367px;" />

All the images that can't stay in the same row are placed in the next row. This algorithm examines all rows until it reaches the last. But, the last row may not have enough images to fill the entire row. In this case you can decide to leave a blank space or to justify the images (<em>justified last row</em> in configuration). But note that, if you decide to justify the last row, and you don't have fixed height, the last images can be much larger than the others.

High quality galleries
----------------------

The plugin is based on the concept that you must have various thumbnails of your images. You know that you can configure the gallery to show your images in different height, and also that plugin may decide to resize some images to fill the remaining empty space. The plugin needs thumbnails of various sizes to guarantee high quality.

In practice, you must resize your images in the upload instead to resize them when someone needs them. The plugin uses, by default, the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.urls.html" target="_blank">Flickr Size Suffix</a>:

	"<strong>_t</strong>": thumbnail, 100 on longest side
	"<strong>_m</strong>": small, 240 on longest side
	"<strong>_n</strong>": small, 320 on longest side
	"<strong></strong>"  : medium, 500 on longest side
	"<strong>_z</strong>": medium 640, 640 on longest side
	"<strong>_c</strong>": medium 800, 800 on longest side
	"<strong>_b</strong>": large, 1024 on longest side

For example, if you have the original image with the name "myimage.jpg", your site must resize this image and create various thumbnails "myimage_t.jpg", "myimage_m.jpg", ... 

This is important because when the algorithm resizes the images, the appropriate image is chosen. And this ensures the maximum quality of the images, with a good bandwidth usage.

How to use the plugin
---------------------

The plugin accepts a standard format for a gallery:

	<div id="mygallery" >
		<a href="myimage1.jpg" title="Title 1">
			<img alt="Title 1" src="myimage1_m.jpg"/>
		</a>
		<a href="myimage2.jpg" title="Title 2">
			<img alt="Title 2" src="myimage2_m.jpg"/>
		</a>
		<!-- other images... -->
	</div>


###Files to include###

The plugin needs some files to work:

	<script type='text/javascript' src='jquery/jquery-1.8.2.min.js'></script>
	<link rel='stylesheet' href='jquery-colorbox/colorbox.css' type='text/css' media='screen' />
	<script type='text/javascript' src='jquery-colorbox/jquery.colorbox-min.js'></script>

	<link rel='stylesheet' href='css/jquery.justifiedgallery.css' type='text/css' media='all' />
	<script type='text/javascript' src='js/jquery.justifiedgallery.js'></script>

The first entry is for JQuery, that I think you use everyday. The second and the third entries are for <a href="http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox" title="Colorbox" target="_blank">Colobox</a>, these entries are optional if you don't use the lightbox option. The last two entries are for the Justified Gallery plugin.

###Just a Call###

Now, you only need to call the plugin that will justify all the images, with the default options.

	$("#mygallery").justifiedGallery();

It's that simple!


Options
-------

In the latter example we used the "_m" suffix, that is the standard suffix for the plugin. But, what if we used a different suffix? 

For example, if we use the "_n" suffix, we have thumbnails that is lower than 320px on the longer side. This time, we need to tell the plugin that we are using this suffix with the option <code>usedSuffix</code> set to <code>'lt320'</code>.

	$("#mygallery").justifiedGallery('usedSuffix':'lt320');

There are other options, let me introduce these by looking at the default values.


###Default Options###

The default options of the plugins are as follows:

	{
		'sizeSuffixes' : {
			'lt100':'_t', 
			'lt240':'_m', 
			'lt320':'_n', 
			'lt500':'', 
			'lt640':'_z', 
			'lt1024':'_b'
		},
		'usedSuffix' : 'lt240',
		'justifyLastRow' : true,
		'rowHeight' : 120,
		'fixedHeight' : false,
		'lightbox' : false,
		'captions' : true,
		'margins' : 1,
		'extension' : '.jpg',
		'refreshTime' : 500
	}

The options: <code>justifyLastRow</code>, <code>rowHeight</code> and <code>fixedHeight</code> correspond to the concepts we have seen before. The default <code>usedSuffix</code> option corresponds to the default <code>rowHeight</code> option considering an average aspect ratio of 4:3.

The <code>sizeSuffixes</code> defines the suffix names, here you can decide the quality of your images in the gallery. For example you may have only a thumbnail for an image and set this option in this way:

	{ 'lt100':'_thumb', 
	'lt240':'_thumb', 
	'lt320':'_thumb', 
	'lt500':'_thumb', 
	'lt640':'_thumb', 
	'lt1024':'' }

The <code>lightbox</code> option specifies that you can show the images with a lightbox. The plugin uses <a href="http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox" target="_blank">Colorbox</a>, you must ensure that you have it installed if you set this option to true.

The <code>captions</code> option specify if you want that the title appears when your mouse is over the image.

<img src="http://miromannino.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/captions.jpg" style="width: 100%; max-width:271px;" />

The <code>margins</code> option sets the margin between the images, in the latter image, for example, this is set to 1. The <code>extension</code> option is used to reconstruct the filename of the images, change it if you use different extensions.

The <code>refreshTime</code> option is the time that the plugin waits before checking the page size, and if it is changed it recreates the gallery layout.

###Choosing the right options###

Choosing the right options is important to have a gallery that uses low bandwidth. In fact, the plugin must know the images width and height, it needs to download them at least one time.
If you have images with an average aspect ratio of 4:3, you can choose which images to put in the HTML code with this pseudocode:

	if rowHeight <= 75:
		#image sizes must be with longest side = 100
		usedSuffix = "lt100"
	elif rowHeight <= 180:
		#image sizes must be with longest side = 240
		usedSuffix = "lt240"
	elif rowHeight <= 240:
		#image sizes must be with longest side = 320
		usedSuffix = "lt320"
	#...

In this way the images you put in the HTML code are probably the ones that are used after the justification. Only some images may be reloaded.
